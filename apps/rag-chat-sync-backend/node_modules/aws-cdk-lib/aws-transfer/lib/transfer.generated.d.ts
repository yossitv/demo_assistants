If you must use an NLB, use port 21 for health checks and enable TLS session resumption by setting `TlsSessionResumptionMode = ENFORCED` . For optimal performance, migrate to VPC endpoints with Elastic IP addresses instead of using NLBs.

In this case, the server automatically responds with one of the endpoint IPs within the PASV response. `PassiveIp=0.0.0.0` has a more unique application for its usage. For example, if you have a High Availability (HA) Network Load Balancer (NLB) environment, where you have 3 subnets, you can only specify a single IP address using the `PassiveIp` parameter. This reduces the effectiveness of having High Availability. In this case, you can specify `PassiveIp=0.0.0.0` . This tells the client to use the same IP address as the Control connection and utilize all AZs for their connections. Note, however, that not all FTP clients support the `PassiveIp=0.0.0.0` response. FileZilla and WinSCP do support it. If you are using other clients, check to see if your client supports the `PassiveIp=0.0.0.0` response.
