/**
 * Creates an *investigation group* in your account.
 *
 * Creating an investigation group is a one-time setup task for each Region in your account. It is a necessary task to be able to perform investigations.
 *
 * Settings in the investigation group help you centrally manage the common properties of your investigations, such as the following:
 *
 * - Who can access the investigations
 * - Whether investigation data is encrypted with a customer managed AWS Key Management Service key.
 * - How long investigations and their data are retained by default.
 *
 * Currently, you can have one investigation group in each Region in your account. Each investigation in a Region is a part of the investigation group in that Region
 *
 * To create an investigation group and set up CloudWatch investigations, you must be signed in to an IAM principal that has either the `AIOpsConsoleAdminPolicy` or the `AdministratorAccess` IAM policy attached, or to an account that has similar permissions.
 *
 * > You can configure CloudWatch alarms to start investigations and add events to investigations. If you create your investigation group with `CreateInvestigationGroup` and you want to enable alarms to do this, you must use `PutInvestigationGroupPolicy` to create a resource policy that grants this permission to CloudWatch alarms.
 * >
 * > For more information about configuring CloudWatch alarms, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html)
