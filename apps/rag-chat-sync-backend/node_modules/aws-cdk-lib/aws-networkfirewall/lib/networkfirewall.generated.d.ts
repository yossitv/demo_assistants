 *
 * > You can retrieve the list of Availability Zones that are available for use by calling `DescribeFirewallMetadata` .
 *
 * To manage firewall endpoints, first, in the `Firewall` specification, you specify a single VPC and one subnet for each of the Availability Zones where you want to use the firewall. Then you can define additional endpoints as VPC endpoint associations.
 *
 * You can use VPC endpoint associations to expand the protections of the firewall as follows:
 *
 * - *Protect multiple VPCs with a single firewall* - You can use the firewall to protect other VPCs, either in your account or in accounts where the firewall is shared. You can only specify Availability Zones that already have a firewall endpoint defined in the `Firewall` subnet mappings.
 * - *Define multiple firewall endpoints for a VPC in an Availability Zone* - You can create additional firewall endpoints for the VPC that you have defined in the firewall, in any Availability Zone that already has an endpoint defined in the `Firewall` subnet mappings. You can create multiple VPC endpoint associations for any other VPC where you use the firewall.
 *
 * You can use AWS Resource Access Manager to share a `Firewall` that you own with other accounts, which gives them the ability to use the firewall to create VPC endpoint associations. For information about sharing a firewall, see `PutResourcePolicy` in this guide and see [Sharing Network Firewall resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/sharing.html) in the *AWS Network Firewall Developer Guide* .
